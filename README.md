# EnhancedSubtitleRetrieval

## Overview
EnhancedSubtitleRetrieval is a **semantic search engine** designed for subtitle processing and retrieval. This project enables efficient searching of subtitles based on meaning rather than just keywords.

## Features
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to retrieve subtitles with contextual relevance.
- **Subtitle Processing**: Cleans and formats subtitle files for accurate search results.
- **AI-Driven Retrieval**: Incorporates machine learning techniques for enhanced results.
- **Efficient Storage**: Leverages **ChromaDB** for embedding management.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
